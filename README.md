# Turing Machine Visualizer


To visualize turing machines there the app turingmachine.io, on it, to create machines you should use a `yml` file, which is'nt a programming language. So, I created this app to visualize turing machines, which are created in a programming language, this give to you the power to do whathaver machine you want.

Now, the machines is visualized throught the terminal, but, it can be extend to others interfaces. Besides, the language that is used to program is Ocaml, but I have the goal to execute in javascript using [js_of_ocaml](https://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/3.1.0/manual/overview) module, feels free to make these features.  

> The app is in development stage, but if you liked the idea, give me a star and come back soon :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:.
